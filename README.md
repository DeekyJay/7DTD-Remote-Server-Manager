# 7DTD Remote Server Manager
The info provided on this wiki will cover installation, sources, FAQ, and general instructions.

7DTD Remote Server Manager is exactly what the title says it is! It allows you to manage your 7 Days to Die Dedicated Server under the assumption that you are using the hacky method for installation on linux and follow the general set up, without going your own route.

Note: Later revisions will allow you to configure what scripts you can call with the commands, just because I understand that not everyone installed the hacky linux version properly.

Later on, I would like to redesign this to have a more modern/metro look to it.

## FAQ
1. I noticed this software saves my SSH and Telnet info. How secure is that?

All information is saved in your %username%/%AppData%/7DTD Server Manager/user.config file.
You'll notice all passwords are encrypting for local storage just in case someone goes snooping.
